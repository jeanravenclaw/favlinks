# favlnk

A simple multi-purpose linker.

This is not a link shortener, but with **favlnk** you can customise your browsers! This was made specifically for Vivaldi web panels, so that you can change the icons on your sidebar.

## How to use

We don't make a new page for every single link. Instead we use URL parameters that you can fill in when saving your shortcut.

```https
https://favlnk.web.app/l?icon=___&url=___&title=___
```

You can input some data to customise your experience! If you have a general idea of how to use them, here's a table showing what each parameter defines.

| Parameter | Description                                |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `title=`  | The title displayed for the redirect link. |
| `url=`    | The url you want the link to go to.        |
| `icon=`   | The icon in the sidebar.                   |

Once you fill in all of these, you can turn the links into web panels, and you can use them as usual!
